## Quick Summary

GraphQL is a query language for APIs that provides:

- **Single Endpoint**: `/graphql` for all requests
- **Client-Specified Queries**: Request exactly the data you need
- **Strongly Typed**: Schema-based type system
- **Efficient**: Eliminates over-fetching and under-fetching
- **Introspective**: Self-documenting API

Magento 2.3.0+ includes native GraphQL support, making it ideal for:

- Progressive Web Applications (PWA)
- Headless commerce implementations
- Mobile app development
- Modern frontend frameworks (React, Vue, Angular)
